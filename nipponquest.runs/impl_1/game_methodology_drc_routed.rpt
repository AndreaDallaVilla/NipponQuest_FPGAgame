TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -13.273 ns between VGA/X_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and VGA/vga_red_reg_reg[0]_lopt_replica_2/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -13.295 ns between VGA/X_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and VGA/vga_red_reg_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
